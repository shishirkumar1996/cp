1. sqrt(n) seems to give accurate result rather than pow(n,0.5).
2. way to read and write to input file is 
  ./a.out < input.txt > output.txt
3. map can be passed by reference.
4. std::endl flushes the internal buffer of c++ runtime  to the operating system on every single line. Therefore we can change endl with '\n" to avoid tle
5. number which is at minimum sum of manhattan distance from a given array is the median of the array
6. map stores its elements in increasing order of its key(first value).
7. priority queue top is the maximum value therefore consider it.
8. we can do constant time erase function in vector therefore it becomes easier to remove elements from a sorted vector
